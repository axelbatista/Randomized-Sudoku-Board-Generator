As the name suggest. One thing that I want to distinguish here is that this doesn't guarantee one unique solution for a board. In order for me to do that, I would need to possibly
blank out some answers and then run a sudoku solver on it (which I also have) and see if there is only one solution in that instance. This is what makes sense to me but I'm not too sure
about it to be honest. Other than that, it follows all the conventions of a sudoku board. If you want to go even further and have a fully commercialized game, you would also
have to add a difficulty option, and for that, I believe it would require you to know about actual mechanics about the game because for example, there are properties like
a medium level game consist of 2 X's or crossfish or something of that nature, and more of them raise/lower difficulty. So if you were to run on checks on patterns on the board 
and then tally it up, you can probably use that as a heuristic for the difficulty.
